# Learning LazyGit

## How do I?

> Bring up the TUI in Neovim with `<leader>gg`

Stage/Unstage files -> move cursor to filename and hit `<Space>` (which will toggle staging)

Commit files -> hit `c` to bring up the prompt for adding a commit message

Push -> hit `P`

Pull -> hit `p`

Rollback/Discard changes to file -> hit `d` to bring up the discard menu; `D` can discard/reset all changes
