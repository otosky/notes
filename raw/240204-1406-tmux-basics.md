## The bare minimum

### Sessions

#### Creating

`tmux new session`

Use the `-s` flag to give the session a name.

`tmn` and `tmns` are my fish-shell abbreviations for these commmands.

#### Detaching

`prefix-d` will detach from the session.

#### Attaching

`tmux attach-session` & `tmux attach-session -t` will attach to an existing session.

`tma` and `tmat` are my fish-shell abbreviations.

You can list all existing sessions with `tmux list-sessions` or `tml`.

### Panes

#### Creation

`prefix-v` to create a vertical-split

`prefix-h` to create a horizontal-split

#### Destruction

`prefix-x` to kill active pane

#### Selection

`prefix-o` to cycle through panes

#### Scrolling

To scroll up into pane you need to enter "copy mode" with `prefix-[`

To exit "copy mode" hit `Ctrl-c`

### Windows

#### Creation

`prefix-c` to create a new window
`prefix-,` to rename the window

#### Destruction

`prefix-X` to kill active window (this is a custom binding)

#### Selection

`prefix-NUMBER` jumps to a window indexed by 0
`prefix-n` cycles through windows
