# Tools
Currently using [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) and 
[vim-zettel](https://github.com/michal-h21/vim-zettel)

## Zettel workflow

1. Open vim and execute command `:ZettelNew`
2. Add a title in the meta block
3. Rename file with `<leader>zrn` and paste the auto-generated filename
using register *, i.e. `<C-r>*`
